Uit de analyse blijkt ook dat tussen 2011 en 2050 de cumulatieve kosten voor uitsluitend netwerkinvesteringen al kunnen oplopen tot 1 500-2 200 miljard, waarbij de hoogste schatting is terug te voeren op hogere investeringen in de ondersteuning van hernieuwbare energie. \",\n",

In het scenario 'groot aandeel hernieuwbare bronnen', waarin ervan wordt uitgegaan dat hernieuwbare energiebronnen een aandeel van 97% in de opwekking van elektriciteit innemen, blijven de elektriciteitstarieven op basis van het model weliswaar stijgen, doch minder snel.
